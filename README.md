Welcome to Carved Rock Fitness

This online shop is based on the Pluralsight course 'Managing React State' by Cory House.
I have developed it in the following ways...

Customer address capture at checkout
Payment information capture and validation
Code has been refactored to separate state controlling components from view components, ie the checkout component now holds the state and there are address and payment components.
I have added SWR caching, and a 1 sec delay to product retrieval to show highligh caching (but not on cart).
I have added random customer purchase tweets
